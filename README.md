# Prof. Dr. Michael Corsten - Personal Website

Bilingual academic website built with Astro and Tailwind CSS.

## Viewing the Site Locally

To view the site in your browser while making changes, run the development server. This allows you to preview changes in real-time.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:4321` in your browser. The page automatically refreshes when you save changes to content files.

## Building for Production

To create a production-ready version of the site for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized static files are generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Updating Content

### Basic Information

Basic information is stored in the following JSON files in `src/content/`:

- `kontakt.json` - Contact information
- `lebenslauf.json` - CV data
- `labels.json` - UI labels

Edit these files directly to update the site.

### Publications

Publications are stored in `src/content/publikationen.json`. You can modify this file directly to add or update publications, or you can use the provided tool to add a publication using its DOI number:

```bash
python tools/add-publication.py 10.1177/13684310211045794
```

### Research Projects and Focus Areas

Research projects and focus areas are stored as markdown files in `src/content/forschungsprojekte/` and `src/content/forschungsschwerpunkte/`. Each entry has a German version in `de/` and an English version in `en/`.

The files use frontmatter (metadata between `---` markers at the top) for information like title, lead, team, funding, and years:

```yaml
---
title: "Project Title"
lead: "Project Lead"
team: "Team Members"
funding: "Funding Source"
years: "2020-2023"
---
