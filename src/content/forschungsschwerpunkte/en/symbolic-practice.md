# Symbolic Practice and Modern Subjectivity

The research focus "Sociology of the Subject, Speech Acts, and Communication in Digital Media" deals with forms of cultural production of subjectivity. Empirical investigations of subject formation processes are combined with general theoretical analyses. On the one hand, these analyses focus on subject genesis within the framework of empirical socialization research and the investigation of linguistic actions; on the other hand, they examine the establishment of subject positions in digital and analog communication and the resulting forms of communication power.

The work in this cluster is oriented toward classical sociology of the subject (or the Anglo-American concept "of the self") following George H. Mead, William I. Thomas, Erving Goffman, Alfred Schütz, and connects this with Bourdieu's habitus model and sociological life course research. Alignments with currently common concepts such as 'subjectivation' and 'singularities' are also examined, as well as distinctions from the formerly fashionable concept of individualization.

Subjectivity refers to the potential and competence of individual actors for individual self-reference, which is socially and particularly culturally generated, produced, and incorporated (in the sense of created and embodied). Thus, subjectivity is not seen as mere "construction," but rather, in Bourdieu's sense, the physical and intellectual capacity of the individual for self-reference designated by subjectivity is seen as an actual opportunity (and obstacle) for self-enablement (ability of self).

Part of the work of this research focus deals with current forms of self-thematization as individual self-reference under the conditions of modern, digital as well as analog communication. Holger Herma's investigations focus on the problem of self-thematization in its specific relationship to the general social conditions of communication.

Sascha Oswald deals with new forms of digital image action, especially self-thematization in the expanded framework of visual communication, e.g., in the form of memes, and the analysis of visual communication styles and genres on Instagram. He also researches processes of community formation in digital space against the background of platform structures and the use of different sign modalities.

In his dissertation "The Selfie as a Form of Visual-Aesthetic Self-Thematization on Instagram," Tobias Wittchen addresses how users thematize themselves on Instagram through the social and aesthetic practice of selfie-making and produce themselves as subjects in the sense of a praxeological understanding of subjectivity.

Laura Maleyka works on the question of whether there is a new relationalization of privacy and publicity in late modernity. Following Hanna Arendt's understanding of privacy and publicity, communication power can be understood as the assertion of meaning.
