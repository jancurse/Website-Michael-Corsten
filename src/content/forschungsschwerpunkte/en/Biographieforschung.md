Biographical research deals with descriptions of life as a social fact (Corsten 1994). This applies in two ways: firstly, biographies have developed as a social form in the process of cultural history and, secondly, they contain the everyday and life practices of individual people as they were lived in the past. In this respect, biographies document the forms in which people's lives were described at certain times, but also indirectly convey the lifestyles of the people themselves through what is described. Biographies therefore contain multi-layered references to the relationship between the individual and society in a historical phase.

Autobiography, habitus and subjectification

A first facet of biographical analysis concerns the process of subjectification of the modern person in relation to the socially generated habitus. Since modernity at the latest, individuals have been called upon to reflect on their individual lifestyles and to define themselves as subjects of these lifestyles. At the same time, in modernity, the individual experiences themselves as a socially formed being who has habitualised essential aspects of their capacity for action and their personality in the process of biographical socialisation. An important branch of research therefore consists in the theoretical determination and empirical reconstruction of the connections between autobiography, subjectification and habitus genesis.
