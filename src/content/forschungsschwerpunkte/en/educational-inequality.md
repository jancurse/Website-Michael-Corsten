Educational inequalities must be seen as a structural feature of modern societies. Given the growing heterogeneity of the student body, ensuring educational equity represents one of the central challenges of modern education systems. The research focus on educational inequality connects to the research areas of educational integration and migration policy at the University of Hildesheim. In various research and doctoral projects, (institutional) causes of different educational success between various social groups are examined, as well as consequences of certain educational biographical experiences. A specific focus is on the educational success of people with a migration background.
