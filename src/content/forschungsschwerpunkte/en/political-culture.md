Civil society engagement and the accompanying development of civic culture are seen as important binding forces and social integration factors in modern societies. Since the beginning of the 21st century, processes of de-solidarization and disenchantment with democracy have increasingly emerged.

The Department of Sociology pursues this issue in several research projects and qualification works. The "Solidarity Discourses in Crises" project, in cooperation with the disciplines of Political Science (Prof. Dr. Kneuer, Prof. Dr. Schammann) and Information Science (Prof. Dr. Heid), uses a discourse-analytical research design to reconstruct the understanding of solidarity among various actors at multiple societal levels (micro - meso - macro).

The dissertation projects of Per Holderberg and Melanie Pierburg deal with facets, forms, and functions of civil society engagement. In his dissertation, Per Holderberg examines the relationship between generational affiliation and the intensity and design of political participation and civil society engagement. To answer the question of whether the determinant of generation has a formative influence on participation in political and civil engagement, secondary analyses of ALLBUS, the Volunteer Survey, and other relevant datasets are conducted both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Melanie Pierburg ethnographically examines continuing education practices in the field of end-of-life care. She is interested in professionalization processes beyond formal professional continuing education and the accompanying self-thematizations at the boundary of pedagogical action. Symbolic work in the context of postmodern dying is at the center of her research.

Christian Seipel's project undertakes an empirical theory comparison, investigating which theoretical approaches can explain the affinity for right-wing populist and far-right attitudes and actions. The modernization losers thesis, the cultural backlash thesis, and the post-democracy thesis are compared in a secondary analysis. The data basis consists of the "General Social Surveys" (ALLBUS) from the years 1996, 2006, and 2016.
