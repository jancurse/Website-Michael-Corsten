# Mathematical Modeling of Social Network Dynamics

## Project Overview

This innovative research project investigates the mathematical foundations of social networks and their temporal evolution. By combining graph theory, stochastic processes, and sociological theory, we develop new models for predicting and analyzing complex social phenomena.

## Theoretical Framework

The central equation of our model describes the probability $P(t)$ of a social connection at time $t$:

$$
P(t) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha(S - \theta)}}
$$

where $S$ is the social similarity between actors, $\alpha$ is the sensitivity, and $\theta$ is the threshold.

## Network Dynamics

The evolution of a social network can be described by a system of differential equations. For the number $N(t)$ of connections:

$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = \beta N(1 - \frac{N}{K}) - \gamma N
$$

Here, $\beta$ represents the growth rate of new connections, $K$ the network capacity, and $\gamma$ the decay of existing relationships.

## Centrality Measures

A particularly elegant result is the harmonic centrality of a node $v$:

$$
H(v) = \sum_{u \neq v} \frac{1}{d(u,v)}
$$

where $d(u,v)$ denotes the shortest path length between nodes $u$ and $v$.

## Integral Formulations

The cumulative influence of a node over time can be expressed as:

$$
I(t) = \int_0^t e^{-\lambda \tau} \cdot w(\tau) \, d\tau
$$

where $\lambda$ is the decay parameter and $w(\tau)$ represents the weight function.

The probability density of connection formation in a network follows:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{t-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2} \, dt
$$

A double integral captures the interaction effect between two social dimensions:

$$
\Phi(x,y) = \int_0^x \int_0^y e^{-(u^2 + v^2)} \, du \, dv
$$

## Expected Insights

Through the application of these mathematical tools, we expect fundamental insights into:

- The emergence of community structures
- Information diffusion in heterogeneous networks
- Stability and resilience of social systems
- Prediction of network transformations

The beautiful Euler identity $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ reminds us that even in complexity, elegance can be found.
