# SEPLIVES: The Structural Conditions of Separated School Careers: A Combined Perspective on Ethnic Stratification and Segregation in German Secondary Education

The integration of an increasingly diversified student body represents one of the most pressing current challenges for the school systems of many Western countries. In addition to central success factors such as targeted language support, the specific composition of schools and classes has increasingly become the subject of research in this area in recent years.

A key question is whether students with a migration background and students without a migration background attend the same schools, or whether migrants are assigned to schools with a high proportion of migrants. The project addresses this question and primarily examines the structural causes of separate school careers for students with and without a migration background. Previous research has focused either on the extent and causes of vertical ethnic stratification across different school types or on the extent and causes of horizontal ethnic segregation between schools of the same type.

The project aims to bring both perspectives together to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the causes of separate school careers. The project has two concrete goals: First, three empirical studies on school choice based on existing datasets (PIRLS/IGLU, CILS4U, school statistics) will be conducted. In addition, the project intends to promote collaboration among early career researchers in the subject area. The aim is to conduct two author workshops that will result in a joint book publication.
